# Developer challenge (website at marktao23.github.io)

This is my personal website as outlined in the developer challenge. As described in my application, I wasn't fully able to completely fix some issues with my navbar, but am overall still satisfied with how things turned out. Thanks so much for reviewing it!

P.S., the master branch contains all of the react.js code for the website!
